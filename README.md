Use this to create a REST API, where users, posts, and comments are submitted to the database.

Then, create a React app that fetches data from the database to display blog posts and comments on the frontend, frontend will also need to recieve comments and push them to the API database

Then, create a second react app that allows me to edit, delete, and update posts and comments

[Don't neccessarily need users, can just allow commenters to leave their name in the comment]

Be able to POST comments and blog posts, DELETE comments and blog posts, and UPDATE comments and blog posts

1. Delete method doesnt work
2. Finish connecting all methods to DB
3. Start frontend
